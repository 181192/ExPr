# Examination details for Basic Cryptography Module

## Reading Lists for the Exam

- Lecture Notes
- [http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cryptography/)

## Exam structure

- No hard calculations!!!
- Come with your pen, pencil & erasers
- 3 parts with different weights. Parts 1 and 2 are the most important.

## Part 1.Definitions and concepts

- Show understanding of the different crypto algorithms and concepts under:
  - Symmetric, Asymmetric, Hashing, Digital Signature, + PKI
- Basics of crypto
  - e.g. substitution, permutation, diffusion, confusion, mono- and poly-alphabetic, gcd, Finding inverse, etc
- Security properties
  - Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authentication, Authorization, Non-repudiation

## Part 2.Practical applications of cryptography

- Real scenarios of crypto application (blockchain excluded!). You will be given an application scenario that requires crypto solution. You will then describe how you can use crypto systems to provide relevant security solutions to the problem.

## Part 3.Bonus Questions

- You should be able to give examples of different crypto algorithms
- You might get names of crypto algorithms and you should be able to fit them into the appropriate category (symmetric, Asymmetric, Hash functions, etc)

**You are allowed to illustrate on the board but NO MATERIAL is allowed for this module!!!**
