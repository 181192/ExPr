#### Computational effort to break Affine Cipher

$$12 * 26 = 312$$

- Brute-force 312 keys.

#### Cryptoanalysis o Affine Cipher

- The Affine cipher incresed the key space over shift cipher
- However, it is still susceptible to:
  - Brute-Force and Frequency analysis attacks

Ciphertext: $y = \{VKZIBEVCCH\}$
