# Examination details for the Blockchain module

The list of reading material is the Blockchain: Reading List. In addition, you have the lecture notes and the assignments.

In the examination of the Blockchain module, you will draw and answer 2 questions.

## The first question

The first question will be about a general blockchain topic (from the lectures / books). You will get one (randomly selected) of these:

- How is a payment carried out in the Bitcoin network?
- Distributed consensus
- What is a blockchain?
- Scripts and Smart contracts
- Scaling and speed
- Applications / use cases

## The second question

The second question will be more about technical details (from the assignments). You will get one (randomly selected) of these:

- Inputs and outputs
- Transactions, signing, validation
- Private key, public key, address, signature
- What is hashing used for?
- The UTXO-set
- Mining, nonce, "target"

It is preferrable that you elaborate on your own. You will probably get follow-up questions. The total examination time for this module is ~10 minutes. You are not allowed to bring notes.
